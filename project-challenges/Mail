Dear Ms. Verdeyen,



I hope you’re doing well.



I am currently working on my Pygame project for the OPO Introductie Project and have recently extended my blackjack program by implementing a splitting function. This feature allows players to split their hand when they receive two cards of the same value, creating two independent hands. While the function appears to work correctly, I am unsure whether it has been implemented efficiently. Although I haven’t encountered any bugs, I suspect there may be edge cases I have overlooked.



Additionally, I would appreciate your input on whether this extension is enough to meet the assignment requirements or if I should implement additional features. As I continue improving my Python skills, I’m open to further enhancing the project if needed. Although based on the assignment requirements, I believe this extension meets the expectations.

You can find my project on GitHub, with the relevant program named Blackjack.py:

I would greatly appreciate your feedback, particularly on the efficiency of my implementation and any potential edge cases I may have missed.



Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your insights.
